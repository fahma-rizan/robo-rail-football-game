Robo Rail Football Game

ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Robo Rail Football Game is an innovative, sensor-driven tabletop football system that redefines conventional play by blending physical interactivity with modern automation and embedded technology.

Designed for two players, the game allows participants to control motorized kicking arms to shoot and defend, while smart sensors and microcontrollers handle scoring, ball detection, and automation. A web application powered by ESP32 ensures that live scores are displayed online, bridging the gap between physical gameplay and digital connectivity.

This project not only delivers an immersive gaming experience but also serves as an educational platform to demonstrate concepts in robotics, real-time systems, sensor-actuator coordination, and embedded programming.


ðŸŽ® Key Features

Automated Scoring System â€“ LDR sensors detect goals with high accuracy.

Ball Tracking â€“ Ultrasonic sensors monitor ball position and detect stagnation.

Automated Side-Kicking Arms â€“ Servo-controlled arms kick the ball back into play when stuck.

Player Control â€“ Joystick-driven DC motors for attacking and defending actions.

Live Score Display â€“ Dual OLED screens show real-time scores.

Web Application â€“ ESP32 sends live scores to an online scoreboard for remote monitoring.

Buzzer Feedback â€“ Audio alert whenever a goal is scored, adding excitement.

Seamless Gameplay â€“ Automated resets and real-time feedback ensure uninterrupted fun.
